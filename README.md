# 3DS patches

## EU Home Menu
**Battery percent in status bar (statusbatpercent)**  
This patch replaces date in statusbar with battery percent. Currently it has some limitations: it needs SM checks patched in Luma3DS (otherwise you will see "SM Fail") and it is not possible to display "%" character, so it shows battery percent as ":35:" instead.

**Battery icon in status bar with 25% bars (statusbaticon)**  
This patch makes the battery icon display each bar as 25% of battery charge. It needs SM checks patched in Luma3DS, same as patch above.
