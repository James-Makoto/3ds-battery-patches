# 3DS patches

## EU Home Menu
**Battery percent in status bar**  
This patch replaces date in statusbar with battery percent. Currently it has some limitations: it needs SM checks patched in Luma3DS (otherwise you will see "SM Fail") and it is not possible to display "%" character, so it shows battery percent as ":36:" instead.
